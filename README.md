# shiny-canpake  - the project firstly about learning github, secondly about making a super mario lookalike #

This is a project mainly focused on learning the basics of working together on Github.  
While learning we of course want something to work on, so we have chosen to make a 2d platformer in the same style as super mario.

There is currently no expectation to end out with a finished product, we are more interested in learning about the process of working together with github insted
